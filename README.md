# Project (Road accident system)

This is my final full-stack courses project with React. The main idea of this project is to help drivers avoid traffic jams and share information on the map. Each user can present information on the map with a photo of the event on the road. Unregistered users can see the map with accident points. Registered users can see more information delete outdated information.

Project fully works only if you share your location.
